			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<h3>Presentation Phase</h3>
			<br>
			This is the Operation Span task. This test measures your ability to remember information while engaging with a separate task. Each trial is made up of a presentation phase and a recall phase.

			You will be <span class='highlight_red'>shown a number</span> (it can be any number from 1-99) in the center of the screen (see the top image). The number will appear for 1 second before being replaced with a simple equation (see image 2). You need to say if the equation is <span class='highlight_red'>correct (using the left key) or incorrect (using the right key)</span>.
			<br>
			<br>
			For <span class='highlight_red'>every</span> number you are given to remember there is an equation to make a judgement on. It is important you try your best when judging the equations as if you remember the numbers but get the equations wrong then you will fail that trial.
			<br>
			<h3>Recall Phase</h3>
			<br>
			One trial will be made up of between <span class='highlight_red'>2 and 6 number-equation pairs</span>. Once you have been given all the numbers in a trial and have judged the veracity of the equations the recall phase begins.

			In this phase you will see the screen in image three for every number you were given to remember. You need to type the number that you recall and press the enter key, you will then be asked for the next number until you input the <span class='highlight_red'>last number</span> for this trial.
